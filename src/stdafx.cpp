  NOTE: The main Readme.md for the original HydraIRC repository states:
  
  "The license for the source is now GPL v3 - many of the source code files still
  refer to the old license, these references are outdated as of 1st October 2014
  and will be replaced with the GPL header."

  I wrote this plugin for a heavily modified version of HydraIRC for Visual Studio
  2015
  
  CoLoRiZe Plugin by Dxzl, 2015

  FYI: Here is the original header for the plugin template-file:

  HydraIRC
  Copyright (C) 2002-2006 Dominic Clifton aka Hydra

       author to be incorporated in the main program.

  2.2) Compile your own version and sell it.
  2.3) Distribute unmodified, modified source or compiled versions of HydraIRC
       without first obtaining permission from the author. (I want one place
